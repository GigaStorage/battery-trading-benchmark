Energy storage plays a crucial role in the energy transition towards a more renewable future.
With the growing focus on renewable energy generation like solar power and wind power, system operators are
 faced with the challenge of ensuring supply and demand are in a constant balance.
Energy storage is a solution to store excess energy when production is high and offer this energy back
 to the market when demand increases.
This allows for a more powerful and resilient energy network.

Aside from the crucial role energy storage plays in the energy transition, energy storage can utilize the energy
 markets to generate revenue.
By utilizing powerful algorithms and strategies, energy storage can make trades and sell their capacity to the
 highest bidder.
They can earn revenue through price arbitrage for example.
Utilizing wholesale markets to buy energy when the price is low, and sell it at a later moment when prices spike.
Or energy storage can sell their flexible capabilities directly to system operators in so-called capacity markets.
These markets are responsible for maintaining the balance of the grid,
 for example by stabilizing frequency on the FCR market.

In the competitive and dynamic environment which the energy market is, it is essential for market participants
 to be able to benchmark and optimize their performance.
A lot of optimisation comes from choosing the right energy market at the right time.
Making use of available assets and market fluctuations.
To challenge the energy community, GIGA Storage strives to develop the Battery Trading Benchmark.
This will be an open-source, advanced optimisation model that can determine the mathematical optimum
 of how a BESS could have been deployed in the energy markets.
This supports market participants to maximize their capture rate in the energy market and realize more BESS projects.

This blogpost is written for anybody interested in (Battery) Energy Storage Systems and how they earn revenue on the
 energy market.
It is part of the open-source repository
 [GigaStorage/battery-trading-benchmark]({REPOSITORY_HOME_PAGE})
 that strives to be the hub for benchmarking how a BESS performs in the current state of the energy market.
In this blogpost, we will deep dive into the first version of this benchmarking tool, and the iterative process taken
 to develop it.
By offering insight into the development of this benchmark, GIGA Storage hopes to contribute to a better understanding
 of how BESS can help the energy transition and what this means for market participants.
As such, this blog post will not deep-dive into the technical details of the developed model.
For follow-up information regarding technical details,

## Version 1. Power (MW) Steering
Revenue is generated on the Dayahead market with a BESS by steering their power (MW).
Depending on what hour the BESS charges or discharges, they will pay, or be paid money to deliver power.
In this benchmark we will assume perfect knowledge of the Dayahead prices on {date_in_title}.
In reality, these prices aren't known when making bids on this market, and are determined by supply and demand.

In the first version of our optimisation, we will only allow power to be steered.
Without diving into the details too much, we will define two schedules to optimise.
A schedule when to charge power, and a schedule when to discharge power.

    solver = pywraplp.Solver('VERSION 1 POWER STEERING', pywraplp.Solver.GLOP_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING)
    charge_power = [solver.IntVar(0, max_power_kw, f'charge_power_period_i') for i in range(0, schedule_length)]
    discharge_power = [solver.IntVar(0, max_power_kw, f'discharge_power_period_i') for i in range(0, schedule_length)]

However, only offering a schedule isn't sufficient information to perform an optimisation, we must give the model
 something to optimise.
This model will benchmark the revenue a BESS can earn on the energy market, so we add the
 rules for earnings and costs to the optimisation.
Costs are generated when charging the BESS or buying energy.
Of course if the energy price is negative then, these costs will be negative, generating revenue.
Earnings are made by discharging the BESS and selling energy.

    costs = sum(charge_schedule[i] / 1000 * length_of_timestep_hour * charge_prices[i]
                for i in range(0, len(charge_schedule)))
    earnings = sum(discharge_schedule[i] / 1000 * length_of_timestep_hour * discharge_prices[i]
                   for i in range(0, len(discharge_schedule)))
    solver.Maximize(earnings - costs)

With no other limitations or considerations, we expect to want to discharge, or generate energy,
 when the prices are positive.
This allows us to generate revenue by selling this energy on the Dayahead market.
Vice-versa, we expect this model charge, or take away energy, when the prices are negative.
This allows us to generate revenue by buying energy at a premium on the Dayahead market.

A BESS is a flexible asset, that can charge and discharge its power quickly.
However it isn't **this** flexible.

st.write("""
## Version 2. Track Capacity (MWh) while steering power
A BESS is a flexible and powerful asset, able to charge and discharge energy from the electricity grid.
We saw in the previous version of our benchmark what steering this power could result in on the Dayahead market.
However a BESS is limited by the amount of power it has stored.
Energy must be charged into the system, before it can be discharged.
The capacity stored in the system is called State of Charge, or SoC for short.
When a BESS charges, it becomes more full.
When a BESS discharge, it becomes more empty.

Converting power (kW), to capacity (kWh) is done with the following formula:

    capacity = power * hour

`Y` amount of power delivered for an `X` amount of hours, results in `Y * X` amount of capacity.
This benchmark is built for the Dayahead market, with different energy prices each hour.
As such the amount of hours `X` here is `X=1`.
We add this capacity to our benchmark as follows:

    capacity = [solver.IntVar(min_battery_capacity_kwh, max_battery_capacity_kwh, f'capacity_period_{i}')
                for i in range(0, len(charge_power) + 1)]
    # Capacity constraint ensure capacity follows from previous timestep
    capacity_from_charging = charge_power[i - 1] * length_of_timestep_hour
    capacity_from_discharging = discharge_power[i - 1] * length_of_timestep_hour
    solver.Add(capacity[i] == capacity[i - 1] + capacity_from_charging - capacity_from_discharging)

One cycle is defined as charging the battery from empty, to full, to empty again.

## Version 4. Add Round-Trip Efficiency, while steering power, tracking capacity and tracking cycles
Up until now we have allowed all charged and discharge power of the BESS to be stored in the SoC of the system.
In reality however, the BESS is not 100% efficient, and the system loses some of this power "to the birds".
You have configured your BESS with {charge_efficiency * 100:,.0f}% charge efficiency
 and {discharge_efficiency * 100:,.0f}% discharge efficiency.
That means that for every 10 MWh charged, only {10 * charge_efficiency:,.2f} MWh is stored in the system.
That means that for every 10 MWh discharged, only {10 * discharge_efficiency:,.2f} MWh is taken from the system.

In the case of charge_efficiency, if the prices are negative, this can improve your revenue.
As you can use more power (which you are being paid to use) before capacity limitations come lurking around the corner.

We add these efficiencies to our previously calculated capacity variables.

    capacity = [solver.IntVar(min_battery_capacity_kwh, max_battery_capacity_kwh, f'capacity_period_i')
                for i in range(0, len(charge_power) + 1)]
    # Capacity constraint ensure capacity follows from previous timestep
    capacity_from_charging = charge_power[i - 1] * length_of_timestep_hour
    capacity_from_charging = capacity_from_charging * charge_efficiency
    capacity_from_discharging = discharge_power[i - 1] * length_of_timestep_hour

We utilise the same optimisation function, lets see how much money the model generates now:

Adding Round-Trip Efficiency to the equation forces the system to sometimes make smaller actions, rather than use the
 full power of the BESS.
It looks like the optimum for steering your {max_power_kw:,.0f} kW BESS with {allowed_cycles:,.2f} cycles
 and {round_trip_efficiency:.0f}% RTE on the Dayahead market would generate â‚¬{optimal_revenue:,.2f} revenue!

## Conclusion
We have developed a model that uses perfect knowledge to benchmark the earnings of a BESS on the Dayahead market.
The following constraints were implemented in an iterative manner to demonstrate their influence on the result and
 the power of this optimisation technique:

* Power (MW)
* Capacity (MWh)
* Allowed Cycles
* Round-Trip Efficiency

For the very alert reader, the model makes some other assumptions regarding the benchmark.
If no `final_battery_capacity_kwh` is configured, the model will often ensure the BESS is empty at the end of the day.
This is because selling all capacity for whatever price will maximize the revenue.
Similarly, if the model is allowed to decide what its `initial_battery_capacity_kwh` is, the model will ensure that
 it starts the day at 100% SoC.
This allows it the possibility to sell as much energy as possible.

This blog post is the tip of the iceberg regarding the Battery Trading Benchmark.
The goal of [GIGA Storage]({GIGA_HOME_PAGE}) is too develop this tool further.
Not only for other energy markets, but with anybody who is interested in benchmarking the revenue of BESS.

The model built in this article as well as the source code of this article is available at
